//! OS keychain storage for the database encryption key.
//!
//! Replaces the previous plaintext `velo.key` file in the app data directory.
//! The key is stored in the platform credential store:
//!   - macOS/iOS  : Keychain Services
//!   - Windows    : Credential Manager
//!   - Linux/BSD  : Secret Service (GNOME Keyring, KWallet, ...)
//!
//! If no credential store is available (e.g. a headless Linux box with no
//! Secret Service provider), the commands return an error and the frontend
//! falls back to the legacy file-based key so the app stays usable.
