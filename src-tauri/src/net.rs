//! Narrowly-scoped outbound HTTP performed in Rust.
//!
//! The frontend used to hold a wildcard `http://*` / `https://*` capability so
//! it could issue RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe POSTs to arbitrary hosts.
//! That capability bypasses the webview CSP, so it doubled as an unrestricted
//! exfiltration channel for any XSS or compromised dependency.
//!
//! This command replaces it with a single fixed-shape request: a POST of the
//! literal body `List-Unsubscribe=One-Click`, whose response body is never
//! handed back to the frontend — only whether the server accepted it.
