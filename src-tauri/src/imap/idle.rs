//! IMAP IDLE — the mail server telling us when something changed.
//!
//! Polling asks "anything new?" sixty times an hour and is told "no" fifty
//! nine of them. IDLE inverts it: the client opens the connection outbound,
//! says IDLE, and the server holds it and speaks when there is something to
//! say. It works from a laptop behind NAT precisely because the connection
//! was dialled out — nothing needs a public address.
//!
//! What arrives is only a doorbell. The payload is ignored and a
//! `naiemail-idle-activity` event is emitted, which the app answers by running
//! the sync it would have run anyway. That keeps the Gmail API as the source
//! of truth for accounts that use it, and only replaces the waiting.
