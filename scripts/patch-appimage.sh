# patch-appimage.sh — make the Linux AppImage work on modern hosts.
#
# The AppImage is assembled by tauri-action on ubuntu-22.04 using
# linuxdeploy-plugin-gtk. Two problems ship in that bundle, both caused by the
# AppImage's own libraries/environment leaking onto the host:
#
# 1. EGL_BAD_PARAMETER hang on launch
#    -------------------------------
#    The plugin bundles the build host's libwayland-client.so.0 (Ubuntu 22.04
#    ships wayland 1.20). That library is on the official AppImage excludelist
#    because it must come from the host — the host's Mesa libEGL dlopen()s it to
#    set up the Wayland/GBM EGL platform. On a newer host the AppImage's
#    LD_LIBRARY_PATH forces the stale bundled copy onto the host libEGL,
#    eglGetPlatformDisplay() fails with EGL_BAD_PARAMETER, WebKitGTK's render
#    process aborts, and no window ever appears:
#
#        Could not create default EGL display: EGL_BAD_PARAMETER. Aborting...
#
#    Fix: drop the excludelisted Wayland libraries so the host copies are used.
#
# 2. External browser (OAuth sign-in) fails to open
#    ----------------------------------------------
#    When the app opens a URL it spawns xdg-open, which inherits the AppImage's
#    LD_LIBRARY_PATH and other GTK/GIO env vars. The browser (or a helper such
#    as kde-open) then loads the AppImage's older bundled libraries — e.g.
#    libssl.so.3 — instead of the host's, fails a symbol-version check, and
#    exits without opening anything. OAuth "opens a browser" but nothing shows.
#
#    Fix: ship an xdg-open wrapper (first on the AppImage's PATH) that unsets the
#    AppImage-injected env vars before handing off to the real system xdg-open.
#
# Both fixes were verified on an AMD Radeon 880M / Mesa / Wayland / KDE host.
#
# Updater-signature caveat: the release asset that tauri-action uploaded was
# signed for the Tauri updater. Repacking produces a different file, so the
# embedded signature no longer matches the asset the updater manifest points
# at. Keep the patch out of the signed updater artifact — publish the patched
# AppImage as the manual-download asset and let the updater serve the signed
# bundle. If the signed bundle is replaced here, in-app updates for AppImage
# installs will fail signature verification until the next release re-signs.
